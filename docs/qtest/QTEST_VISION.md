# QTest Vision: Universal Testing Intelligence Platform

## Executive Summary

QTest evolves from a simple test generator into an **Autonomous Testing Intelligence Platform** that revolutionizes software quality assurance. By integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP), we enable testing of any codebase, website, or application with zero manual effort.

**Vision Statement**: "The Testing Platform That Thinks - Not just generating tests, but understanding intent, learning from failures, and preventing bugs before they happen."

---

## üéØ Core Mission

Transform software testing from a manual, time-consuming process into an intelligent, autonomous system that:
- **Generates** comprehensive test suites automatically
- **Evolves** tests as code changes
- **Learns** from test failures to improve
- **Predicts** where bugs will occur
- **Prevents** issues before production
