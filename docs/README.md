## üîç Key Concepts

### Multi-LLM Strategy
- Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Groq
- Intelligent routing with fallback chains
- Provider quota management with token buckets
- Cost optimization through provider selection

### Multi-Tenancy
- Three isolation levels: Schema, Database, Row-level
- Resource quotas and rate limiting per tenant
- White-label support for enterprise customers
- Billing integration with Stripe

### Agent Architecture
- Role-based agents (Architect, Developer, Tester, Reviewer)
- Temporal workflow orchestration
- Inter-agent communication via NATS
- Parallel execution with dependency management

### Observability
- OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- Prometheus metrics with custom dashboards
- Structured logging with sensitive data redaction
- Real-time alerting and anomaly detection
