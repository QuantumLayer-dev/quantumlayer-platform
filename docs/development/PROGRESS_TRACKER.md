## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Confirmed Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go 1.22+ (performance-critical), Node.js (supporting services)
- **Workflow**: Temporal v2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 + Redis
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant (primary), alternatives available
- **API**: GraphQL (primary), REST (compatibility), gRPC (internal)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes-first, multi-cloud ready
- **LLM Strategy**: Multi-provider with intelligent routing

### Architecture Patterns
- ✅ Monorepo with Turborepo
- ✅ Microservices with service mesh
- ✅ Event-driven architecture
- ✅ CQRS for complex operations
- ✅ Clean architecture principles

## 🔄 Session Continuity Notes

### For Next Session
1. **Priority**: Begin actual implementation starting with repository setup
2. **Focus Area**: Multi-LLM router and provider abstraction layer
3. **Infrastructure**: Create K8s namespaces for V2
4. **Repository**: Initialize monorepo structure in GitHub

### Important Context
- Currently on Proxmox with GPU available
- Existing K3s cluster ready for deployment
- Multiple LLM providers to integrate (Groq for speed, Bedrock for enterprise)
- Focus on demo-ready development (can be revisited later)

### Key Decisions Pending
1. Exact monorepo structure (Turborepo vs Nx)
2. Primary programming language split (Go vs Node.js per service)
3. Initial LLM provider for MVP
4. Authentication provider finalization

---

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. **Create GitHub repository** in QuantumLayer-dev org
2. **Initialize monorepo** with basic structure
3. **Setup development environment** with Docker Compose
4. **Create first microservice** (API Gateway)
5. **Implement basic LLM router** with at least 2 providers

---

## 📝 Notes
- All architectural decisions documented in FRD
- Focus on billion-dollar features for differentiation
- Multi-LLM and cloud-agnostic approach critical for success
- Demo-ready infrastructure moved to backlog for later implementation
