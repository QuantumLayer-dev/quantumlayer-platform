2. **Infrastructure**: Deployed PostgreSQL and Redis to Kubernetes
3. **Tree-sitter Parser**: Complete code parsing service with 23+ languages
4. **LLM Router**: Multi-provider routing service with health checking and fallbacks
5. **Documentation**: Organized into proper structure (architecture, planning, operations, development)

### For Next Session
1. **Priority**: Agent Orchestrator implementation
2. **Focus Area**: Temporal workflow setup for agent coordination
3. **Infrastructure**: Deploy LLM Router to K8s with API keys
4. **API Gateway**: Create GraphQL gateway to unify services

### Important Context

- Existing K3s cluster ready for deployment
- Multiple LLM providers to integrate (Groq for speed, Bedrock for enterprise)
- Focus on demo-ready development (can be revisited later)

### Key Decisions Pending
1. Exact monorepo structure (Turborepo vs Nx)
2. Primary programming language split (Go vs Node.js per service)
3. Initial LLM provider for MVP
4. Authentication provider finalization
