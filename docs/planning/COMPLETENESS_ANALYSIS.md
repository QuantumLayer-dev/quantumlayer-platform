## üìù Final Verdict

**We have 65% of required documentation**, with excellent coverage of architecture, security, and business logic. The critical gaps are in:

1. **Development setup** (needed immediately)
2. **Deployment configuration** (needed for Week 1)
3. **Testing infrastructure** (needed for Week 2)

With 1-2 days of focused work on these gaps, we'll have everything needed to start building a production-ready platform.
