## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Simplifications for MVP
1. **Use Templates**: Start with template-based generation
2. **Single LLM**: Use only OpenAI initially
3. **Basic Auth**: Simple API key authentication
4. **No Streaming**: Request/response model first
5. **Local Storage**: Save generated code locally

### Can Add Later
1. Advanced NLP parsing
2. Multi-agent coordination
3. Real-time streaming
4. Multiple LLM providers
5. Cloud storage integration

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Biggest Risks
1. **LLM API Keys**: Get at least OpenAI key immediately
2. **Complexity Creep**: Keep first version very simple
3. **Integration Issues**: Test each component individually first
4. **Time Constraints**: Focus on critical path only

### Contingency Plans
1. **If Temporal fails**: Use simple job queue
2. **If GraphQL complex**: Start with REST
3. **If frontend delays**: Use Postman for demo
4. **If generation fails**: Use pre-made templates

- [x] Completed: What was finished
- [ ] In Progress: What's being worked on
- [ ] Blocked: Any blockers
- [ ] Tomorrow: Next priority
```

## 💡 Remember

1. **Keep It Simple**: MVP doesn't need all features
2. **Test Early**: Verify each component works
3. **Document As You Go**: Don't leave it for later
4. **Ask for Help**: If blocked, seek assistance
5. **Stay Focused**: Avoid scope creep

---

## 🎉 Victory Conditions

The MVP is successful if we can:
1. Take a prompt: "Create a todo app with React"
2. Generate working React code
3. Package it with dependencies
4. User can run it locally
5. System doesn't crash

That's it! Everything else is bonus.
