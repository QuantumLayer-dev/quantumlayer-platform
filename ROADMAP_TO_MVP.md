# üó∫Ô∏è QuantumLayer Platform - Realistic Roadmap to MVP

## Executive Summary
**Current State**: Infrastructure 100% complete, Core Product 10% complete, Frontend 0%  
**Time to MVP**: 4 weeks minimum  
**Time to Production**: 8 weeks  
**Critical Path**: Build the actual code generation engine!

## üìä Current Reality Check

### What's Actually Working (40%)
‚úÖ **Infrastructure** (100% - Over-engineered)
- Kubernetes + Istio service mesh
- Temporal workflow orchestration

- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
- CI/CD pipeline with GHCR

‚úÖ **AI Components** (80% - Mostly built)
- LLM Router with multi-provider support
- Agent Orchestrator with 8 specialized agents
- Meta-Prompt Engine (built, not deployed)
- AI Decision Engine (built, not deployed)
- QSecure Engine (built, not deployed)

### What's NOT Working (60%)
‚ùå **Core Product - QLayer** (10%)
- No actual code generation engine
- No project structure generation
- No template system
- No quality validation
- No QuantumCapsule packaging

‚ùå **Frontend** (0%)
- No Next.js application
- No user authentication
- No dashboard
- No code editor
- No real-time updates

‚ùå **Other Products** (0-20%)
- QTest: Not started
- QInfra: Only K8s manifests (20%)
- QSRE: Only monitoring (30%)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk
- **Core engine complexity**: Start simple, iterate
- **LLM costs**: Implement caching aggressively
- **User expectations**: Clear MVP limitations

### Medium Risk
- **Performance issues**: Optimize critical path only
- **Security concerns**: Basic auth first, enhance later
- **Deployment issues**: Use existing infra

### Low Risk
- **Infrastructure**: Already over-built
- **Monitoring**: Already in place
- **CI/CD**: Already configured

## üí° Key Decisions

### What to Build
‚úÖ Simple code generator  
‚úÖ Basic web UI  
‚úÖ Authentication  
‚úÖ Download feature

### What to Skip (for now)
‚ùå Multi-tenancy  
‚ùå Advanced agents  
‚ùå Marketplace  
‚ùå Voice/AR/VR  
‚ùå Fine-tuning

### Technology Choices
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (already decided)
- **Auth**: Clerk (simple to integrate)
- **Editor**: Monaco (VS Code editor)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (rapid development)

## üéØ North Star

**Remember**: The goal is to generate working code from natural language.  
Everything else is secondary.

**Focus on**: Getting one happy path working perfectly.  
**Ignore**: Edge cases and advanced features.

**Success looks like**: A user types "Create a Python REST API for a todo app" and gets working code they can run.
